# MP2--NSM170002
This is a repository that contains the files requested for the MP2 assignment for SE 4367.001 by Navin Mathew (NSM170002)

I have attached the following files.
  - driver.java
  - my-aligned.apk
  - my.keystore

The driver.java is the java file that contains the code that help generate the updated sq3.apk into the sootOutput folder as per part 1 of MP2.

The my.keystore is the generated keystore that was made by part 2 of MP2.

The my-aligned.apk was the apk updated sq3.apk that was zipaligned and then signed by jarsigner as per part 2/4 and part 3 of MP2.

I have vertified the zipalign and also the signed apk using the commands provided by MP2.

Please let me know if there is any errors at the email NSM170002@utdallas.edu
